crushpngs is a wrapper around pngcrush to help with handling a large number
of files.

It provides a way to only work on files modified since a certain date, and
gives a brief summary of the savings. It also works around an unfortunate bug
in some versions of pngcrush where the "crushed" file is sometimes larger
than the original.

Feature wishlist:
 * Feedback while running; I know that there are N files to process, but how
   far through am I?
 * More intelligently determine what is and isn't a PNG
 * Options to ignore certain paths/patterns
 * Read stored options from a dot file
