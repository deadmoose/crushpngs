Crushpngs
=========

Crushpngs is a wrapper around [pngcrush](http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush)
to help with handling a large number of files.

It provides a way to only work on files modified since a certain date and
gives a brief summary of the savings. It also works around an unfortunate bug
in some versions of pngcrush where the "crushed" file is sometimes larger
than the original.
